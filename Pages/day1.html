        There is a overriding function called Activate() which will be overridden by 
        the user and implement there code as they want it maybe by changing the order 
        of the Move, PlaySound and SpawnParticles or maybe their own implementation.

        <span style="text-decoration-color: brown; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted">  Span is very similar to  but the main difference is that can have attributes which targets the whole content inside it, while  can also have attributes but it targets an inline content. </span>
